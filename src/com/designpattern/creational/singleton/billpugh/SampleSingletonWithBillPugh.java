/**
 * Prior to Java5, memory model had a lot of issues and above methods caused failure
 * in certain scenarios in multithreaded environment. So, Bill Pugh suggested a concept
 * of inner static classes to use for singleton.
 * When the singleton class is loaded, inner class is not loaded and hence doesnâ€™t
 * create object when loading the class. Inner class is created only when getInstance() method is called.
 * So it may seem like eager initialization, but it is lazy initialization.
 * This is the most widely used approach as it does not use synchronization.
